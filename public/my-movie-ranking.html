<h1>Ajith's Favorite Movie Reviews</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Marvel movies of all time.</h2>

<hr>

<h3>
    1. Avengers Endgame.
</h3>
<p>
    After over a decade of build-up, this film encapsulates all of the best elements of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
</p>
<h3>
    2. Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3.
</h3>
<p>
    Similar to Endgame, there has been 10 years of buildup with some really lovable characters and deep diving into the past and their origins.
</p>
<h3>
    3. Captain America: Civil War
</h3>
<p>
    Taking a fan favorite team, the avengers, and having them divide and fight amongst one another is one of the greatest moments in the MCU.
